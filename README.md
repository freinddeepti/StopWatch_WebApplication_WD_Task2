# StopWatch_WebApplication_WD_Task2
The device is used when time periods need to be measured precisely and with minimum complications. Laboratory experiments and sports events like sprints are classic examples of its application.
Stopwatch watch is like a watch that shows us the time from zero. Stopwatch is mostly used in the competition or personal use to know that time we took to do some activities.

As you can see on the given image of your project [Stopwatch in HTML CSS and JavaScript], generally stopwatch contains three buttons as on the image. One button is for to start time, the second is for stop the time and the third is for resetting the time. Our stopwatch can show us time till the hour.
